#### Project Overview 🚀
D-Save is a decentralized savings pool application designed to incentivize users to save their crypto assets in a secure, transparent, and decentralized manner while earning interest on their deposits. Built on the DChain platform using React JS and Solidity, D-Save leverages the security and transparency of DChain to offer a user-friendly and efficient savings solution. This project aims to empower individuals and communities by providing them with a reliable and profitable way to manage their digital assets, contributing to the broader adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.
